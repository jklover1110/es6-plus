## Intro

- Post-ES6-time Best Practices
- Next Generation ECMAScript Challenges
- Deliberate Practice with TDD (Test-Driven Development)

## Play Locally

Install the packages locally.

```bash
pnpm install

# or use npm
npm install
```

Then DIY your code in the `main.js` file of each question.

Finally, try to pass the unit tests with TDD.

```bash
pnpm test

# or start the tests with UI
pnpm test:ui
```

BTW, you might get the answer in the `index.js` file of the same directory.
